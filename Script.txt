Idea:
The game is about a man with ordinary life. In his childhood he was given medicine "BeGood" to help him develop better from a pharmaceutical company Espada Pharmaceuticals. The medicine worked well, but when he became an adult, side effects began to appear. He goes insane at his job and does brawl in the office. In the end there will be choice, to get a cure and become a famous writer or go insane more and stay in hospital for a long time.
The inspiration is taken from Katana Zero and Hotline Miami
